# houdini-principal-curvature
A Houdini DSO that extracts the minimal and maximal principal curvature directions from geometry.

## Installation
0. Clone the repository, including dependencies, e.g `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mruegenberg/houdini-principal-curvature.git`
1. Modify `compile.sh` or `compile.bat` (on Windows) to use your Houdini installation
2. Compile with the script
3. Move the resulting `dll`/`dylib`/`so` to your `HOUDINI_DSO_PATH` or add the path where it is located to it, 
   e.g export HOUDINI_DSO_PATH="`pwd`/dso;&"

### Notes
As of Houdini 17.5, `hcustom` requires `csh` to be available under Linux

## Usage
The node takes just one input. It writes `min_principalcurvature` and `max_principalcurvature` point attributes.

The input mesh must be triangular (e.g using the *Divide* or *Remesh* SOPs).

## Dependencies

- [libigl](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/) performs the actual principal curvature direction determination

- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) is used heavily by libigl

## License
The code itself is under the MIT and MPL2 licenses.
Eigen and libigl (the dependencies) are under the MPL2 license.
